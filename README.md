# Gradient-Descent
I created this jupyter notebook as part of the Fastai course. We were asked to pick a certain topic/concept used in deep learning and then research about it to reinforce our learning. I thought it's worthwhile to dig into a fundamental concept which is why I chose the topic of Gradient Descent. Here is my approach to reinforce my knowledge.
1. Understand the fundamentals of Gradient Descent. (what does it do)
2. Research different variants of Gradient Descent.
3. Implement different variants of Gradient Descent and compare their performances.
